This repo contains everything you need to make a power supply board for class A amplifiers.
You can open the schematic and board in `Diptrace`.
It's designed to fit in the cases supplied by the `DIYaudio store` without having to mount your transformer vertically.
I used it for my `First Watt M2` clone and worked great!
