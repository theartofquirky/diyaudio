# Modded Cygnet MKII


I while ago I bought a pair of Cygnet MK2 speakers as a DIY kit from Madisound.

Overall they were very good budget speakers but there some things that I didn't like about them:

The woofer sounded sort of paper-y, like tapping a cardboard box or something. I think this is the effect of a small enclosure. There was also a lack of bass generally.

After a lot of discussions on [this thread](https://www.diyaudio.com/forums/multi-way/150218-mtm-design.html) and some experimentation and simulations, I decided to do the following modifications:

* Replace the original series 1st order crossover at 4khz with a custom made 2nd order crossover at 2khz and 4db baffle step compensation  
*  Replace the crazy square port with a flared round port at 3 inch dia x 110 mm length located at the back and 3 inches off the bottom (behind the tweeter)
* Do some extensive chamfering of all front edges with 10 x 10 mm chamfer or radius (I think the chamfer looks nicer). This is cosmetic and also helps with diffraction   
* Use more bracing connecting the front, back and side panels. I also like to use wood hardener.
