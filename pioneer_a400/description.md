# Pioneer A400

What can I say about the A400. It first come out around 1990 and Pioneer really got this one right. A budget amplifier that punched well above it’s weight.

I’ve always wanted to listen to this ‘giant killer’ so I got myself one from eBay. I got it for £80 in non-working condition, the seller said the volume pot was bad.

Not much to comment on on the outside, the chassis has a very simple design, kinda uninteresting. However the good stuff’s inside. 

Inside the layout is clean and you will find good quality parts, such as Elna electrolytics everywhere. Descent size transformer and great looking honeycomb heatsink. Pioneer used wire wrapping for the key connections here, which reminded me of older amps.

Onto the repairs. First things first, all of the electrolytics had to be replaced. On a 30 year old amp you just have to do it before you do anything else. I tend to use Panasonic FC or Nichicon FG for low to medium values, and Elna Silmic for signal path. Also this time I used EPCOS for mains filtering, I really wanted to these caps and they are great.

Moving on to the volume pot. Scratchy or open pots are a common problem with amplifiers that age, however the original Alps pot on this one is very difficult to replace like for like as it’s kind of unique. It’s a dual linear pot with a concentric / split shaft which acts as balance control. It also has a forth set of leads which is a 40% tap. This is sometimes used for loudness circuitry, in this case it’s used to fake log law.

The reason for that is that linear pots generally have better accuracy / tracking between channels, you are better off faking log law with a linear pot rather than using a log pot. You can still use a log pot and be okay (in fact many people use the Alps blue velvet log pots with success) but you could end up with channel level mismatch with poorly matched pots. You could remedy that by using a trimmer to match channels at listening levels, or hand pick pots by measuring them at around 20-40% position.

In my case I was able to find a genuine Alps pot very similar to the original one. It still needed some work to get it to fit as the lead spacing and lengths were all different, but nothing some point to point wiring couldn’t fix. Unfortunately it did not have a split shaft so the balance functionality had to be sacrificed.

I have to say I found working on this amplifier a bit difficult. The main issue was access to the backside of the PCB as it’s elevated from the bottom of the case. Moreover the chassis cutout made it difficult to reach the edges for desoldering, especially for removing the volume pot. I ended up removing the PCB, which actually wasn’t too hard to do and made life a lot easier afterwards.

I also found the traces were quite sensitive to force and temperature when desoldering, so you have to be careful. I did find a few cracked solder joints here and there which were responsible for intermittent sound.

So how is the sound you ask? Simply put, it’s just awesome! It’s everything I expected it to be. 

The verdict:

* Thumbs down for quality, I’ve seen worse but remember it’s a budget amp
* Thumbs down for looks, uninspired and plasticky front panel
* Thumbs up for repairability, easy to fix even with its tricky volume pot
* Thumbs up for sound, the main reason you will buy this amp
