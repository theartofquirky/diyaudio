# Denon PMA-700AE

First released in 2007 the PMA-700AE represented a 'going back to basics' philosophy for Denon offering audiophile quality at affordable cost.

Outside it follows a 'less is more' approach to design which definitely works and gives a feeling of effortless quality.

Same story inside with clean layout and quality parts. Descent size transformer and very adequate heat-sinking and ventilation. Quality Elna caps are used for rail filtering and elsewhere.

The main board is thoughtfully designed with lots of test points and molex connectors making troubleshooting easy. It really is a pleasure working on this amp.

This amplifier had a "stuck at stand-by mode" problem after power up.

After a little bit of probing around with the multimeter the fault was located with the power transformer. Mains voltage was going in but nothing was coming out. I took it out for further examination and indeed the primary tested open. Bingo.

I also tested the connection to the main board for dead shorts to ensure no further damage. Output devices and main filter caps also seemed in good knick with no dead shorts.

I really like the sound of this amp. It's clean and transparent but not clinical. Sad to have to let it go. I highly recommend buying a second hand one.

So a transformer swap and a general clean was enough to bring the amp back to 'as new' state. Due to its age a recap isn't necessary, all caps appeared to be in excellent shape.

Verdict
* Thumbs up for repairability and quality
*Â Thumbs up for sound
* Thumbs up for looks
